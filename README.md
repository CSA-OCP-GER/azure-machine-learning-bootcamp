# Azure Machine Learning Bootcamp Bootcamps

Here are the top two resources you'll need this afternoon:

1. [Azure Machine Learning Services documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/)
1. [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py)

# Challenges

## Challenge 1 - Model training on Azure

In this first challenge, you'll be training a machine learning model on Azure. We'll be using the popular MNIST dataset, as it allows us to focus on getting familiar with the mechanics of Azure Machine Learning.

Tools needed:
* Machine Learning service workspace (preview) - Deploy from Azure Portal
* [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com)
* [`utils.py`](utils.py)

## Challenge 2 - Model deployment on Azure

In this second challenge, you'll be taking the model you've trained in the first challenge and deploy it to Azure Container Instances (ACI). Alternatively, you can deploy it to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Challenge 3 - Automated Machine Learning

In this last challenge, you'll be using Automated Machine Learning to let Azure figure out which machine learning algorithm performs best on your dataset.
